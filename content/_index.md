    description: Every day I wake up and I try to better understand the world we live in.<br/> As one of the lead member of the team that designed and is currently implementing the EU’s AI strategy, I firmly believe in the importance of bringing together different fields of study to drive an appropriate use of AI in society.<br/><br/> I'm interested in a wide range of subjects including ICT law, digital economy, innovation policies, philosophy and international relations. I'm also passionate about data analysis. On the other hand, I am a strong advocate of the need to reflect on the ever-growing use of technologies and to protect and promote fundamental rights in the digital world.
