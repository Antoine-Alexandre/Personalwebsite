    description: Every day I wake up and I try to make sense of the world we live in. Graduated in political science, international economics and human rights law, I firmly believe in the importance of cross-sectional analysis to understand policies and regulations adopted at national and international level.<br/><br/> I'm interested in a wide range of subjects including ICT law, digital economy, innovation policies, philosophy and international relations. I'm also passionate about data analysis. On the other hand, I am a strong advocate of the need to protect and promote fundamental rights in the digital world.
