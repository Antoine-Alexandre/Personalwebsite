    description: Every day I wake up and I try to make sense of the world we live in. Graduated in both political and economic science, I firmly believe in the importance of cross-sectional analysis to understand policies and regulations adopted at national and international level.<br/><br/> I'm interested in a wide range of subjects including artificial intelligence, digital economy, innovation policies, ICT law, philosophy and international relations. Also, as a former researcher in economics, I'm passionate about data analysis. On the other hand, I am a strong advocate of the need to protect and promote fundamental rights in the digital world.
