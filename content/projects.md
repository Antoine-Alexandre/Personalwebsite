    description: <p><span class="default-text bold-text">- "Economic Considerations and Citizens’ Support for the EU&#58; the Eurozone Crisis and Post Crisis Situation"</span> (MA thesis - May 2019)</p><br/></p>In this paper, I explore the link between economic factors and EU support in the period from 2010 to 2017. In particular, I ask whether the European sovereign debt crisis, and the countries’ economic weaknesses associated to it, causes a change in the "driving forces" explaining citizens’ support for the EU. Contrarily to existing studies, this research investigates the temporal dynamics of individuals’ support dividing Europe in regions affected differently by the crisis.</p><br/><p><span class="default-text bold-text">- "La neutralité du net dans l’Union européenne &#58; les enjeux d’une réglementation pour défendre l’accès de tous à tout le réseau Internet"</span> (MA thesis - Aug 2018)</p><br/><p>In this paper (written in French), I analize the EU's regulation on open internet access (2015). In particular, I ask whether this piece of legislation fully addresses the various concerns related to the non respect of net neutrality in the Digital Single Market. Contrarily to the existing literature, I review the guidelines adopted by BEREC (Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications) and the way they have been enforced by different NRAs (National Regulatory Authorities).</p>

    description: <p><span class="default-text bold-text">- Personal data analyzers</span> (ongoing)</p><br/><p>In 2016, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was created to harmonise data privacy laws across the EU. This regulation aims at making it easier for users to understand how their personal data are being used. Yet, most of the time, users have very little easy to use tools to understand the amount and type of data they create. <br/><br/>Interactive data narratives can help to make personal data more transparent. With data visualization it's easier for users to realize the type of information one can extrapolate using basic data analysis. The idea behind this project is, therefore, to give to users easy to use personal data anylizers. Its main purpose is not to diverge people from using one peculiar platform, but rather to raise awareness on the magnitude of information we are giving to centralized technological companies&#58; the more data one company can extract from one user, the more it can predict and probably influence (e.g. <a class="blue-text bold-text" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/06/cambridge-analytica-how-turn-clicks-into-votes-christopher-wylie">Cambridge Analytica</a>) users' behaviour.<br/><br/> A first tool analysing data from Whatsapp conversations has been designed. The next steps of this project include the development of data analyzers for other popular platforms and the creation of a website bringing together the different tools and promoting data protection as well as citizens' fundamental freedoms in the digital world.</p><br/><br/><p><span class="default-text bold-text">- Garden Network</span></p><br/><p>During my studies at Université catholique de Louvain I co-founded, with three of my best friends, a community startup promoting urban agriculture for students on the university campus.<br/><br/>Starting on our own balcony, we designed and built a vertical kitchen garden made of almost 100% recycled materials (wood pallets,…). Eager to share our experience of urban agriculture, we created a formal structure aiming at bringing together students to build vegetable gardens and share farming tips, seeds,…<br/><br/>In total, more than 700 people participated in the project and around 150 kitchen gardens were built in two years. In that period of time, we also have created several partnerships with public and private actors (for instance, the clothing stores <a class="blue-text bold-text" href="https://www.cameleon.be/fr">Caméléon</a>). In addition, our idea has inspired student projects in other universities in Belgium and abroad.</p><br/><p>Launching video can be found <a class="blue-text bold-text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoFqLiuCqvA">here</a>.</p><br/><p>People talking about us <a class="blue-text bold-text" href="https://www.lesoir.be/art/1185468/article/demain-terre/developpement-durable/2016-04-19/des-potagistes-bac-5-sur-campus">here</a>, <a class="blue-text bold-text" href="https://www.lavenir.net/cnt/dmf20160413_00810876/un-potager-vertical-sur-le-balcon-du-kot">here</a> and also <a class="blue-text bold-text" href="https://www.tvcom.be/video/videosujet_17212.html#gsc.tab=0">here</a>.</p><br/><br/><p><span class="default-text bold-text">- This website</span></p><br/><p>I have always been keen on data analysis and data visualization. Going one step further, in June 2020, I decided to create a personal static website from scratch. This experience has been really mindblowing! The potential brought by web design excites me enormously. I'm really looking forward to practice more web development through the creation of another (dynamic this time) website (see "Personal data analyzers" above).</p>
